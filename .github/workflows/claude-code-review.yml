            FIRST, check for any previous review comments from this bot:
            1. Use `gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments` to list all comments
            2. Look for comments containing the marker `<!-- claude-code-review -->` - these are your previous reviews

            THEN, adapt your review based on whether previous reviews exist:

            **If this is the FIRST review (no previous comments with the marker):**
            - Provide a comprehensive review covering: code quality, potential bugs, performance, security, and test coverage
            - Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions

            **If there ARE previous reviews:**
            - Read your previous review comments to understand what feedback was already given
            - Focus ONLY on what's new or changed since your last review
            - Keep your comment SHORT and focused on the delta
            - Acknowledge if previous feedback was addressed
            - Don't repeat feedback that still applies - just reference "previous comments still apply" if needed

            Use `gh pr comment` to post your review. Start your comment with the HTML marker `<!-- claude-code-review -->` on its own line (invisible but allows tracking).
