    A complete rikishi with name, origin, abilities, and individual stats.

    The relationship between current ability and individual stats:
    - current: Overall ability score (5-100) representing total capability
    - Individual stats: Specific attributes (1-20 each) that sum up to represent
      how the current ability is distributed across different areas
    - When current ability increases through training, individual stats improve
    - The starting distribution: all stats begin at 1, then (current - 5) points
      are randomly distributed among the five stats

    Attributes:
        shikona: Ring name with interpretation.
        shusshin: Place of origin.
        potential: Maximum ability the rikishi can reach (5-100).
        current: Current overall ability level (5-100).
        strength: Physical strength stat (1-20).
        technique: Technical skill stat (1-20).
        balance: Balance and stability stat (1-20).
